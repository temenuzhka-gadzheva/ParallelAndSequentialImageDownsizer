# ParallelAndSequentialImageDownsizer 🖼️

The ParallelAndSequentialImageDownsizer is a project that offers an efficient solution for reducing the size of images through the use of C# WinForms. This project allows users to choose between two modes of image processing: parallel (using threads) 🧵 and sequential ⏳, providing flexibility and performance optimization according to specific needs and hardware resources.

## Key Features 🌟

- **Parallel Size Reduction**: Utilizes threads to simultaneously reduce the size of images, optimizing performance on multi-core systems. 🚀
- **Sequential Size Reduction**: Processes images one after another, ideal for systems with limited resources or in scenarios where consistent load handling is a priority. 🐢
- **Intuitive GUI**: Offers an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to quickly select the processing mode and images for processing. 🖥️
- **Support for Various Formats**: Capable of working with multiple popular image formats, such as JPG, PNG, BMP, etc. 📸
